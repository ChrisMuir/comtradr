Package changes implemented in this version:

## NEW FEATURES

* Modifications to `ct_search()` to allow for pulling all monthly data for an entire year in a single query ([#14](https://github.com/ropensci/comtradr/issues/14))
* For function `ct_search()`, expanded the valid input types for args `start_date` and `end_date` ([#10](https://github.com/ropensci/comtradr/issues/10)).

## BUG FIXES

* `ct_search()` now supports all commodity classifications offered by UN Comtrade ([#16](https://github.com/ropensci/comtradr/issues/16)).
* The updates generated by function `ct_update_databases()` are now properly preserved between R sessions ([#11](https://github.com/ropensci/comtradr/issues/11)).
* Passing `"services"` to arg `type` within function `ct_search()` now uses commodity classification `EB02` by default (previously this would throw an error, fixes [#6](https://github.com/ropensci/comtradr/issues/6)).
* When using commodity classification `EB02` within function `ct_search()`, passing `"TOTAL"` to arg `commod_codes` no longer returns zero results ([#7](https://github.com/ropensci/comtradr/issues/7)).
* `ct_commodity_lookup()` no longer returns zero results when passing all caps input to arg `search_terms` ([#9](https://github.com/ropensci/comtradr/issues/9)).
